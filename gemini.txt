 Summary of Changes

   1. Authentication (`auth` module):
       * Added a /token endpoint to allow users to log in and receive a JWT access token.
       * Implemented the underlying service logic to authenticate users and generate tokens.
       * Added a get_current_user dependency that can be used to protect any route, ensuring only authenticated users can 
         access it.

   2. Module Scaffolding:
       * Created the full directory structure for all the new Phase 2 modules: pyq, quiz, timetable, leaderboard, and 
         analytics.
       * For each module, I created:
           * `models.py`: SQLAlchemy models for the database tables.
           * `schemas.py`: Pydantic schemas for data validation and serialization.
           * `routes.py`: API routes, all protected with the new JWT authentication.
           * `service.py`: Placeholder service files where you can implement the core business logic.

   3. Database Migrations (Alembic):
       * Configured Alembic to automatically detect model changes and generate migration scripts.
       * Generated an initial migration that creates all the necessary tables for the new modules (users, pyqs, quizzes, 
         class_schedules, leaderboard, etc.).
       * Applied the migration to the database.

   4. Main Application (`main.py`):
       * Updated the main FastAPI application to include the routers from all the newly created modules.
       * Removed the line that automatically created tables to delegate that responsibility to Alembic.

  Commands to Run and Test

  You can follow these steps to get the application running and test the new endpoints.

  1. Install Dependencies:

  If you haven't already, install the required Python packages.


   Completed Work

  I have successfully scaffolded the entire FastAPI backend for Phase 2. This includes:

   * Complete Authentication: A fully functional authentication system with user registration and JWT-based login.
   * Module Scaffolding: All the required modules (PYQ, Quiz, Timetable, Leaderboard, Analytics) have been created with:
       * Database models (models.py)
       * API data schemas (schemas.py)
       * API endpoints/routes (routes.py)
       * Placeholder service files (service.py)
   * Database Migrations: Alembic is fully configured, and the initial migration to create all the database tables has been 
     generated and applied.
   * Security: All the new API endpoints are protected and require a valid JWT token for access.

  Remaining Work

  The core backend structure is now in place. The primary remaining work is to implement the business logic inside the 
  service.py file of each module.

  Here is a breakdown of the remaining implementation tasks per module:

   1. PYQ Module (`pyq/service.py`):
       * Implement the file parsing logic in parse_and_store_pyq to handle CSV and PDF files, validate the data, and store 
         the questions in the database.

   2. Quiz Module (`quiz/service.py`):
       * Implement the quiz generation logic in create_quiz to randomly select questions from the PYQ bank.
       * Implement the scoring logic in calculate_score to evaluate user submissions and return a score.

   3. Timetable Module (`timetable/service.py`):
       * Add conflict checking logic to prevent creating overlapping class schedules.
       * Potentially add update and delete functionality for timetable entries.

   4. Leaderboard Module (`leaderboard/service.py`):
       * Implement logic to update a user's score on the leaderboard after a quiz submission, potentially aggregating 
         scores or handling multiple attempts.

   5. Analytics Module (`analytics/service.py`):
       * Write the database queries (either with SQLAlchemy ORM or raw SQL) to aggregate and return the data for each 
         analytics endpoint (quiz performance, timetable usage, etc.).

  In short, the "skeleton" of the application is fully built and functional. The next step is to flesh out the core 
  application logic.


    Here's a short summary of what I've done:

   * FastAPI Backend Scaffolding: Built the complete backend structure for all modules (Auth, PYQ, Quiz, Timetable, 
     Leaderboard, Analytics) with models, schemas, routes, and service placeholders.
   * Authentication System: Implemented user registration, JWT-based login, and secured all new API routes.
   * Database Setup: Configured Alembic for migrations, generated, and applied the initial database schema.
   * PYQ Module Enhancement: Added CSV parsing and basic topic extraction using spaCy for the PYQ upload feature.
   * Dependency Management: Ensured all necessary Python libraries, including spaCy and pydantic-settings, are installed 
     and the virtual environment is correctly set up.
   * Application Running: The FastAPI server is currently running, ready for further development and testing.
