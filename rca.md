ðŸ”Ž RCA â€“ Problem Statement & Solution (HexamGen)
Problem Statement Recap

Students and faculty face fragmented academic workflows â€” static timetables prone to clashes, scattered past year question papers (PYQs), and monotonous study practices that reduce engagement and exam readiness.

Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
1. Why students struggle with preparation?

Surface Symptom: Students spend hours searching PYQs and notes.

Root Cause: No central repository or smart filtering of high-frequency questions.

2. Why do timetables clash or fail to adapt?

Surface Symptom: Students miss classes or face overlap in schedules.

Root Cause: Timetables are manually prepared, static, and updates are not communicated effectively.

3. Why is revision unstructured and boring?

Surface Symptom: Students revise randomly and drop consistency.

Root Cause: No adaptive practice mechanism or gamification to keep motivation high.

4. Why is faculty burdened with admin tasks?

Surface Symptom: Teachers/admins spend time fixing clashes, making schedules, and sharing resources.

Root Cause: Lack of automation in scheduling and content delivery workflows.

HexamGen Solution â€“ How It Addresses the Root Causes
Root Cause	HexamGen Solution
No central PYQ analysis	AI-powered PYQ Analyzer â†’ extracts topics, finds high-frequency questions, builds knowledge maps.
Static, clash-prone timetables	Smart Timetable Manager â†’ CSP/graph-based scheduling + Google Calendar sync for instant updates.
Passive, boring revision	Adaptive Quiz Generator + Gamification â†’ auto-MCQs, flashcards, streaks, badges, leaderboards.
Faculty admin overload	Admin Portal â†’ upload PYQs, review AI-generated quizzes, approve/schedule in one click.
RCA Visualization (5 Whys)

Problem: Students waste time, miss schedules, and lack engaging study methods.

Why 1? They revise randomly and miss timetable updates.

Why 2? Because timetables are manual and static.

Why 3? Because no automation tools are integrated in their academic workflow.

Why 4? Because institutions lack AI-driven platforms for scheduling + learning.

Why 5? Because existing solutions solve parts (e.g., Kahoot = quizzes, UniTime = scheduling) but not the integrated workflow.

âœ… HexamGen fixes this root gap by combining scheduling + PYQ analytics + adaptive quizzes + gamification into one platform.

ðŸŽ¯ RCA Takeaway for Judges

Youâ€™re not just fixing surface problems (boring revision, timetable clashes).

Youâ€™re solving the core inefficiencies: fragmentation, lack of automation, and low engagement.

HexamGen = Root-cause-driven innovation â†’ efficiency + engagement + reduced admin effort.


Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of HexamGen
1. Problem Recap
Both students and faculty face fragmented academic workflows, manual static timetables prone to clashes, scattered past year question papers (PYQs), and monotonous, passive study practicesâ€”all leading to wasted time, low engagement, and ineffective exam preparation.

2. Identified Core Problems & Root Causes
A. Inefficient Preparation

Surface Symptom: Students spend excessive time searching for relevant notes and PYQs.

Root Cause: Absence of a centralized repository with smart filtering and analytics to surface important, high-frequency questions/topics.

B. Timetable Clashes & Missed Updates

Surface Symptom: Overlapping classes or missed sessions are common.

Root Cause: Timetables are manually built and not dynamically updated, with poor communication of changes.

C. Unstructured, Boring Revision

Surface Symptom: Students revise haphazardly and lose motivation.

Root Cause: Lack of adaptive, gamified, and engaging revision tools; no streaks, reward systems, or active progress tracking.

D. Faculty Administrative Burden

Surface Symptom: Educators spend significant time fixing timetables and distributing resources instead of focusing on teaching.

Root Cause: No automation in resource sharing, scheduling, or quiz creation, leading to repetitive manual work.

3. RCA Visualization â€“ 5 Whys (Condensed)
Why (level)	Root Cause Found
Why 1?	Students miss schedules and revise randomly.
Why 2?	Manual, static timetablesâ€”no prompt updates or smart filtering.
Why 3?	Academic workflows lack automation tools or integration.
Why 4?	Institutions lack unified, AI-driven platforms for workflow automation.
Why 5?	Existing systems are single-purpose (only scheduling or quizzing), not integrated
4. How HexamGen Addresses Root Causes
Central PYQ & Resource Hub: AI-powered analyzer identifies key topics and high-frequency questionsâ€”reducing student search time.

Smart Timetable Manager: Automates conflict-free scheduling with Google Calendar sync for real-time updates.

Adaptive Gamified Quizzing: Generates MCQs, flashcards, and uses streaks, badges, and leaderboards to drive motivation and consistency.

Automation for Faculty/Admin: Admin portal for one-click timetable publishing, resource uploads, and quiz approvals, drastically reducing repetitive manual overhead.

5. RCA Takeaway
The true inefficiency is not just in boring revision, scattered notes, or timetable clashes, but in the fragmented and non-automated academic process.

HexamGenâ€™s integrated approach directly targets these root inefficienciesâ€”delivering greater workflow efficiency, increased engagement, and much lower admin effort by centralizing, automating, and gamifying the entire academic workflow
